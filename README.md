# Customer-Frustration-Discovery-and-Sentiment-Analysis-Platform

The purpose of this work was to deploy a single platform for studying the processes of customersâ€™ contacts with the company and establishing the degree of their dissatisfaction with regard to received feedback and orders. This enables sentiment and frustration scores to be derived from large-scale customer navigation combined with information related to orders. Such a system permits the performance of routines for data cleansing, preprocessing and transformation with a view of strengthening the quality of data and thus enhancing traditional inferences that are embedded in algorithms of customer prediction models.
